							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/res01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>An open world, 2D farming game. Dictionaries and events are the corner stone 
								of this project, as well as deeveloping a time system, which counts
								minutes, hours, days, seasons, and years.<br></p>
								<br>
							<h3>The World</h3>
							<p>The Unity Tilemap has been used to build the
								 world map of the game. In the project, classification layers
								  have been used to order and build the different features of the map.
								   From these layers, the Tilemap has been used to define certain 
								   properties of the Grid, with the use of scripts and Booleans, which 
								   allow certain actions to be carried out in certain parts of the 
								   world.</p>
								   <span class="image fit"><img src="images/res00.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<h3>Time and the harvest</h3>
							<p>The plants are connected with the time system, with the passing of the days each plant passes in cycles.</p>
							<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
							<p>Dictionaries are one of the corner stones in this project. Unlike an array or list, it is considered unordered,
								 and is accessed by a "key" rather than an "index," which makes it easier to work with and access objects. If you were managing 
								 the objects as a list or as an array, every time you wanted to get a reference to an object, you would have to "loop" through 
								 each item in the list until you find the one that matches. With a dictionary, you can basically say, "give me the item named 
								 'Such' and immediately get its reference.</p>
